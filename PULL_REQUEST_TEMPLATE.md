## Background

< Description and context of what you were asked to do. Try to be as detailed as possible. Give enough background to the reviewer to perform the code review. >

## Changes done

< High level description of what changes you introduced in this PR. Don't bother going into details as they can be seen in the code. Describe _what_ was done, not how or where. >

## Pending to be done

< What things you left out and why. Maybe you left testing out because the PR was too big already? Maybe you will be following up with a second part with validations? Let your reviewers know! >

## Notes

< Any design decisions not obvious in the code. Did you have to go outside of our standard? If so, why? >

## Demo

< Screenshot/video to better understand the idea. >
