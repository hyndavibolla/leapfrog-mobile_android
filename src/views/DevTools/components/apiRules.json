Bright and cheery with plenty of seating, you can enjoy the exotic flavors and smell the fragrant spices in every bite regardless if you go for lunch, dinner or snacks. There are a variety of noodle bowls to try, including the Hoy Ka noodles with pork, the drumstick noodles, and yen ta fo with squid, fish balls, tofu, pork and more. While there's no doubt that the noodle bowls are the star of the show, this eatery offers a full menu loaded with Thai specialties. Stir-fried noodles, Thai salads, spring rolls, fried rice, and entrees like crispy pork, chili green rice, and kao prao seafood offer diners plenty of choice. With years of tradition and heritage behind each freshly prepared dish of food, there's no place quite like Hoy Ka Noodle.",

To start at square one, all the marvelous baguettes, artisan breads, rolls and pastries are baked fresh. Then everything that goes on, in, or around the bread is equally fresh and fabulous. At 7 a.m. every morning, folks in the kitchen start breaking the farm-fresh organic eggs to prepare breakfast paninis, wild blueberry pancakes, and French toast that's stuffed, grilled or battered with wild blueberries, toasted almonds, creamy ricotta, and other scrumptious goodies. The lunch and dinner sandwiches are a treasure trove of fine meats and cheeses (soy cheese substitute available) topped with organic greens, veggies, and fruits in all manner of creative combinations. And, of course, salads play a starring role here in light of their glamour, grace and well-dressed style. Expect trendy appointments and an upscale,  health-conscious crowd interested in fast-casual for the thinking man and woman.  P.S. Professional catering services are available for all social and business functions.

The Roaring Twenties-themed decor and eye-catching, quirky newspapers from that bygone era are the perfect backdrop whether you're dining in or grabbing take-out. Staying awhile is always preferred, especially when you begin pairing your favorite pizzas with one of the craft brews. You may want to sample The Sun, a specialty pie with a red sauce base and a combination of mozzarella, honey smoked ham, bourbon bacon, aged sharp cheddar, pineapple, grape tomatoes, and scallions. If none of the regular creations catch your eye, create your very own pizza and watch it prepared right in front of you! There are even vegan options made with Daiya Cheese, so everyone gets to savor The Pizza Press' headliners.",

                "description": "Family and the kitchen are the heart and soul of an Italian dining experience, and this core concept behind Frankie's New York Italian Restaurant has kept it one of Melrose Avenue's favorite eateries for more than 20 years. Family owned and operated, owner Frank Competelli (Frankie) and every member of his staff, strive to make you feel welcome and diners often feel like they are dining in a home rather than in a restaurant. Add to this convivial and charming ambiance a distinct New York City Italian flare and you'll soon begin to understand why people continue to flock to this outstanding restaurant.  It also helps that the food is as good as any dish you'd find in Little Italy - from the Maine Lobster Fra Diablo to the Baked Clams Alla Vincent, hearty pastas, Veal Parmigiana and juicy chops and steaks, every dish is simply divine. Every single meal is made from scratch and from only the very best and freshest ingredients, so regardless if you're dining on a garden-fresh salad or a hearty seafood meal, you simply won't find any better quality dishes. Only a fabulous hand-mixed cocktail or stunning glass of wine could possibly make the meal any more delectable, and they've got plenty of libations to assuage any thirst. Open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats (the kitchen is open until 12:00 a.m.), and with a décor that is comfortable, casual and lightly upscale, every meal at this eatery promises to be fabulous. Dine inside or out, the choice is yours, but when you are craving a fabulous New York style Italian meal, head to Frankie's New York Italian Restaurant - stop by or call for reservations today!",

Not only will you discover delicious signature creations to try, but the staff has a mastery of old classics that is second to none. The Roaring Twenties-themed decor and eye-catching, quirky newspapers from that bygone era are the perfect backdrop whether you're dining in or grabbing take-out. Staying awhile is always preferred, especially when you begin pairing your favorite pizzas with one of the craft brews. You may want to sample The Sun, a specialty pie with a red sauce base and a combination of mozzarella, honey smoked ham, bourbon bacon, aged sharp cheddar, pineapple, grape tomatoes, and scallions. If none of the regular creations catch your eye, create your very own pizza and watch it prepared right in front of you! There are even vegan options made with Daiya Cheese, so everyone gets to savor The Pizza Press' headliners.",

Family owned and operated, owner Frank Competelli (Frankie) and every member of his staff, strive to make you feel welcome and diners often feel like they are dining in a home rather than in a restaurant. Add to this convivial and charming ambiance a distinct New York City Italian flare and you'll soon begin to understand why people continue to flock to this outstanding restaurant.  It also helps that the food is as good as any dish you'd find in Little Italy - from the Maine Lobster Fra Diablo to the Baked Clams Alla Vincent, hearty pastas, Veal Parmigiana and juicy chops and steaks, every dish is simply divine. Every single meal is made from scratch and from only the very best and freshest ingredients, so regardless if you're dining on a garden-fresh salad or a hearty seafood meal, you simply won't find any better quality dishes. Only a fabulous hand-mixed cocktail or stunning glass of wine could possibly make the meal any more delectable, and they've got plenty of libations to assuage any thirst. Open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats (the kitchen is open until 12:00 a.m.), and with a décor that is comfortable, casual and lightly upscale, every meal at this eatery promises to be fabulous. Dine inside or out, the choice is yours, but when you are craving a fabulous New York style Italian meal, head to Frankie's New York Italian Restaurant - stop by or call for reservations today!",

Entrees include choices like whole crispy striped bass, Alaskan halibut, and filet mignon in a cognac sauce. Happy Hour specials are available weekdays from 4-6:30 at the bar, the bar lounge, and bar patio, or stop by any time for a meal that's delicious and crave-worthy.

This is the kind of place where you can kick back, relax and enjoy delish food along with great times in a retro-inspired eatery. With plenty of convenient locations, you can take a break in your busy day and enjoy some of the simpler things in life, including service that is always fast and friendly, and a menu with something for everyone. Try their famous 1/3 pound burgers -- Fresh, never frozen 100% domestic farm-raised beef and they are always made to order. Famous for their cheese steaks served on hearth-baked Amoroso rolls, these hearty sammies have an authentic Philly flavor. Fries (potato or sweet potato), are the perfect side to any meal, and as great as it all is, be sure to save room for a shake! The thick and creamy shakes at Johnny Rockets are always hand-dipped and hand-spun from whole milk, quality ingredients and premium ice cream. All-American fare served with a smile is what you'll find every time you go to Johnny Rockets!",

Not only will you discover delicious signature creations to try, but the staff has a mastery of old classics that is second to none. The Roaring Twenties-themed decor and eye-catching, quirky newspapers from that bygone era are the perfect backdrop whether you're dining in or grabbing take-out. Staying awhile is always preferred, especially when you begin pairing your favorite pizzas with one of the craft brews. You may want to sample The Sun, a specialty pie with a red sauce base and a combination of mozzarella, honey smoked ham, bourbon bacon, aged sharp cheddar, pineapple, grape tomatoes, and scallions. If none of the regular creations catch your eye, create your very own pizza and watch it prepared right in front of you! There are even vegan options made with Daiya Cheese, so everyone gets to savor The Pizza Press' headliners.",

Family owned and operated, owner Frank Competelli (Frankie) and every member of his staff, strive to make you feel welcome and diners often feel like they are dining in a home rather than in a restaurant. Add to this convivial and charming ambiance a distinct New York City Italian flare and you'll soon begin to understand why people continue to flock to this outstanding restaurant.  It also helps that the food is as good as any dish you'd find in Little Italy - from the Maine Lobster Fra Diablo to the Baked Clams Alla Vincent, hearty pastas, Veal Parmigiana and juicy chops and steaks, every dish is simply divine. Every single meal is made from scratch and from only the very best and freshest ingredients, so regardless if you're dining on a garden-fresh salad or a hearty seafood meal, you simply won't find any better quality dishes. Only a fabulous hand-mixed cocktail or stunning glass of wine could possibly make the meal any more delectable, and they've got plenty of libations to assuage any thirst. Open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats (the kitchen is open until 12:00 a.m.), and with a décor that is comfortable, casual and lightly upscale, every meal at this eatery promises to be fabulous. Dine inside or out, the choice is yours, but when you are craving a fabulous New York style Italian meal, head to Frankie's New York Italian Restaurant - stop by or call for reservations today!",

                "description": "For more than 55 years, Pizza Hut has been one of America's most loved pizzerias. Nowhere else can you find one-of-a-kind pizza creations that range from traditional favorites to creative flavors that offer each diner a chance to try something new and different. Their famous pan pizza and stuffed crusts are iconic mainstays of the menu, and, with fresh and flavorful toppings, you can have it your way any day. The lover's pizzas are another popular choice, and with options like meat, veggie and the ultimate cheese lover's pizzas from which to choose, there's no shortage of variety. Pizza Hut is also a leader in creating new flavorful experiences, thanks to pizzas like the pretzel piggy with its signature pretzel crust or the BBQ bacon cheeseburger pizza. Pizza Hut offers more than just pizza; irresistible breadsticks and flavor sticks, Wing Street Wings, and even pastas round out the diverse menu, making this an easy to recognize family favorite. No matter if you dine-in, carry-out or call for delivery, Pizza Hut is all about making delicious dishes for life's favorite moments.",

The thick and creamy shakes at Johnny Rockets are always hand-dipped and hand-spun from whole milk, quality ingredients and premium ice cream. All-American fare served with a smile is what you'll find every time you go to Johnny Rockets!",

The Roaring Twenties-themed decor and eye-catching, quirky newspapers from that bygone era are the perfect backdrop whether you're dining in or grabbing take-out. Staying awhile is always preferred, especially when you begin pairing your favorite pizzas with one of the craft brews. You may want to sample The Sun, a specialty pie with a red sauce base and a combination of mozzarella, honey smoked ham, bourbon bacon, aged sharp cheddar, pineapple, grape tomatoes, and scallions. If none of the regular creations catch your eye, create your very own pizza and watch it prepared right in front of you! There are even vegan options made with Daiya Cheese, so everyone gets to savor The Pizza Press' headliners.",

Family owned and operated, owner Frank Competelli (Frankie) and every member of his staff, strive to make you feel welcome and diners often feel like they are dining in a home rather than in a restaurant. Add to this convivial and charming ambiance a distinct New York City Italian flare and you'll soon begin to understand why people continue to flock to this outstanding restaurant.  It also helps that the food is as good as any dish you'd find in Little Italy - from the Maine Lobster Fra Diablo to the Baked Clams Alla Vincent, hearty pastas, Veal Parmigiana and juicy chops and steaks, every dish is simply divine. Every single meal is made from scratch and from only the very best and freshest ingredients, so regardless if you're dining on a garden-fresh salad or a hearty seafood meal, you simply won't find any better quality dishes. Only a fabulous hand-mixed cocktail or stunning glass of wine could possibly make the meal any more delectable, and they've got plenty of libations to assuage any thirst. Open for lunch, dinner and late-night eats (the kitchen is open until 12:00 a.m.), and with a décor that is comfortable, casual and lightly upscale, every meal at this eatery promises to be fabulous. Dine inside or out, the choice is yours, but when you are craving a fabulous New York style Italian meal, head to Frankie's New York Italian Restaurant - stop by or call for reservations today!",

With plenty of convenient locations, you can take a break in your busy day and enjoy some of the simpler things in life, including service that is always fast and friendly, and a menu with something for everyone. Try their famous 1/3 pound burgers -- Fresh, never frozen 100% domestic farm-raised beef and they are always made to order. Famous for their cheese steaks served on hearth-baked Amoroso rolls, these hearty sammies have an authentic Philly flavor. Fries (potato or sweet potato), are the perfect side to any meal, and as great as it all is, be sure to save room for a shake! The thick and creamy shakes at Johnny Rockets are always hand-dipped and hand-spun from whole milk, quality ingredients and premium ice cream. All-American fare served with a smile is what you'll find every time you go to Johnny Rockets!",
